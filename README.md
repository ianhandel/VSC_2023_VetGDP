This app is designed to process the data UK vet schools received in 2023 regarding the Vet GDP Graduate and Advisors survey.

The analysis within the app will provide schools with comparable analyses to R(D)SVS approach. It will not provide R(D)SVS with your school's data. 

We have found this analysis useful for accrediation purposes and hope to make our approach available to others, as part of an enhancement led approach to quality assurance.
